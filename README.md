# SVM Classification - Breast Cancer Dataset

This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using two selected features.


# Steps Covered

1. Load Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn`
2. Select 2 features: `mean radius`, `mean texture`
3. Train SVM with Linear and RBF kernels
4. Visualize decision boundaries
5. Tune `C` and `gamma` using GridSearchCV
6. Evaluate with cross-validation
